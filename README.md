## Flutter Coding Challenge by Yuchen Dai:

### This app is adapted from : [this post](https://resocoder.com/rive-flutter-animations). An album playing animation was added to the original project to showcase my understanding.

<br />

## Prerequisites:

### Before you begin, make sure you have met the following requirements:

- Flutter SDK installed: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Install an older version of JDK. Here I use JDK 8: [Java SE 8 Archive Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)

<br />

### If you have no prior knowledge about setting up and app development, you can follow these steps:

- Download and install Android Studio: [Andriod Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Install Flutter and Dart plugins
- Follow previous section to download and install Flutter SDK and JDK 8
- Make sure to add Flutter SDK and JDK 8 to your environment variables and the project setting
- Run "flutter pub get" in the project directory to get all dependencies
- Set up emulator by "Create Virtual Device" in AVD manager
- Launch the emulator and then run main.dart
